# 20. Valid Parentheses
## Language: Python

Add open parenthesis types to the stack. Remove open parenthesis to stack if you see the close for that parenthesis. If the top of the stack is an open for one type and a close is seen for another type, it does not get removed. By the end of the program running in O(n) time, if the stack has anything in it, it's not valid because they were not added and removed the appropriate nubmer of times.
