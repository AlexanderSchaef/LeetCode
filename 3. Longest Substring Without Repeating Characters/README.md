# 3. Longest Substring without Repeating Characters
## Language: Python
## Approach: Brute Force
1. Start with each character in the string, and add it to a new string
2. Compare all following characters until you see a character that exists in the string
3. If you see a character that exists in the string, stop computation on that line, store the value, repeat until all possible variations are calculated
