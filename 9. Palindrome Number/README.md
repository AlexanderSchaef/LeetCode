# 9. Palindrome Number
## Language: Python
## Explanation:
Trivial Problem. Question specifies that -121 = 121- reversed and is therefore not accepted. This means that the reverse can be done in a string representation, and python allows for reverse strings very easily with string[::-1]. If the string version of the integer is equal to its inverse, then it is a palindrome.
